## Basics 


### Git

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - open-source software for version control
- Git keeps track of file changes and enables you to label them and preserve multiple version histories of a project
- Why use it?
  - Avoid file conflicts! Other collaboration/syncing tools are not designed for code
  - It helps you test code, troubleshoot, or 'undo' changes
  - Be intentional: package your changes logically, document and explain your work

### [GitHub](https://www.github.com) 

- A popular code repository for sharing and collaborating: it hosts code and enables users to manage collaboration on projects (using Git for version control).
- Why use it?
  - Widely used to develop and share open-source tools and datasets
  - Free web hosting with static site builder ([GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/))
  - Makes collaboration visible and transparent
  - It's what we're using to share and preserve your hackathon projects!


## Versioning vocabulary

**Repo or repository** (n.) 
: A discrete project on GitHub that contains a set of files, a change history, and a set of contributors. (E.g. [this one](https://github.com/tri-co-hack-2022/repo-template))

**Fork** (v.)
: To copy a repo's files and version history to a new one with its own settings (preserves connection with original repo but doesn't interfere). 

**Local** (adj.)
: On your computer.

**Remote** (adj.)
: On someone else's computer (aka 'the cloud').

**Clone** (v.)
: To download a local copy of a repo on GitHub with a tracked connection to the remote repo.

**Branch** (n.)
: A version of a repository with its own history. Branches can be created for a unique set of changes and later *merged* with the main branch to avoid file conflicts.

**Commit** (n.)
: A discrete set of changes to a repository that a user packages and labels.

## Getting Started with Git and GitHub

### Setting up Git on your local machine

Options:

- Install a GUI Client such as [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) *recommended*

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to use it from the command line and/or

  use Git/GitHub features for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#:~:text=Visual%20Studio%20Code%20has%20integrated,on%20the%20VS%20Code%20Marketplace.) or another text editor

### Setting up a repo on github

1. Sign in to your GitHub account
2. Create a new repository, import one from your computer, or **fork** one already on GitHub
3. Add recommended files: a ReadMe for documentation, a license (optional), and a .gitignore
4. **Clone** the repository to your computer
5. Open your **local** copy in VSCode or another text editor
6. Save your work often and use Git to track the changes

### Git process and commands

#### add

`git add newfile.md`

After you create a new file or save changes, tell git to track the file (also called 'staging')

NB: this stage is implicit in GitHub Desktop and on GitHub, but it's important on the command line.

#### commit 

`git commit -m "message describing my changes"`

Package your staged changes and label them for others' awareness

#### pull

`git pull`  

Update your local repo with any changes that have been committed to the remote repo

#### push

`git push origin main`

Send your changes to the remote repository and publish them on GitHub

#### Other commands 

- `git status` - see if you have staged changes
- `git branch branchname` - create a new branch
- `git checkout branchname` - switch to another branch

### Branching [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

Avoid file conflicts by working on your own branch 
![github branching diagram](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-42360/images/help/repository/branching.png)

1. Create a branch 
2. Make changes: add, commit, push, repeat
3. Make a pull request: discuss and review your commits
4. Resolve conflicts & merge pull request 
5. Delete branch
   

### Using the Hackathon template

1. Have one team member **fork** the [Hackathon repo template](https://github.com/tri-co-hack-2022/repo-template) and invite the rest of your teammates as collaborators
2. Edit the README.md file with your team's information using markdown
3. Collaborate!
4. Share your repository link with the Hack-a-thon organizers


## [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a lightweight, human-readable markup language: it encodes information in plain-text to be machine readable
- Why use it?
  - Platform-agnostic create simple rich text markup with any text editor
  - Easily human-readable compared to other markup languages (html)
  - Can be converted into any kind of document (more lightweight and sustainable than word processors)
  - It's used for documentation on GitHub 

### Syntax

```
# First level heading 

## Second-level heading

Paragraph with **bold** text and *italicized* text.
